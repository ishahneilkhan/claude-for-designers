      <p>Hi Najnin Nahar Ratna,</p>

      <p>Before I start on the booking screen, three things need a decision from your side:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Payment path.</strong> The brief assumes one card checkout across all markets. Bangladesh needs bKash as the primary path alongside card — it's not a logo swap, it's a different flow shape: app switch, PIN, OTP, a hand-typed transaction ID, then an async verification wait. That's 3–4 extra screens and new error states your current UK conversion numbers (19%) don't have to account for. I've scoped this in — can you confirm the extra screens are approved within the current timeline?</li>

        <li><strong>Success metric.</strong> The brief measures tutor signups, but parents are the ones who book and pay — Rafi's confirmed you agree on this, it just hasn't made it into the brief. I'm designing for the parent as the primary user. Flagging this in case the success metric needs to change too.</li>

        <li><strong>Bengali.</strong> I've seen conflicting signals — you said optional, your manager said strongly preferred. I need one answer to plan the UI strings correctly, since retrofitting translation later costs more than designing for it now.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Separately: video calling and the verification badge both came up after the 3-lakh scope was agreed. I'm treating both as new scope, not part of this cycle — happy to send a separate estimate for either once they're confirmed as priorities.</p>

      <p>Aiming to lock this by 28/08/2026 to stay on the three-week timeline. Happy to jump on a call if easier.</p>

      <div class="signature">
        <p>Thanks,</p>
