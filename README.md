Claude for Designers
A working repository for designers who use Claude as a collaborator. Skills, principles, project templates, and a career vault. Not a pile of prompts to paste, a system to work inside.

Read this before you start
This is not a beginner UX course. It assumes you already know UX fundamentals: research, flows, hierarchy, critique. What it teaches is how to get your Claude setup right so you direct AI instead of operating Figma.
What it costs. Claude Pro, about $20 a month, plus the free Claude Desktop app. That is the honest number. There is no free path that does what this course needs.
Your account must be your own. Never share a login, never buy a seat in someone else's account, never split one subscription between friends. Shared accounts get flagged by IP and held, and you lose access mid-course. Two students learned this the hard way last batch.
Where to start
Download the folder, open it in Claude Code, and type:

explain this folder to me
Claude reads CLAUDE.md, works out which class you are on by looking at which files are still blank, and tells you which file is today's. That is the fastest orientation available. Do it before reading the rest of this page.

Why this exists
Claude with no context produces work any agency in any city could ship with the same prompt. That is the commodity end of design, and it is the part AI is eating fastest.

The designers who stay valuable bring what Claude structurally cannot: a real brief, a real user, a real market, and the judgment to push back. This repo is the scaffolding for that. It makes the context permanent so you stop re-briefing Claude every conversation, and it keeps the decisions yours.

How the folder grows
You do not get a finished workspace. You build it one file at a time. Each class: open one file, learn why it exists, fill it in for your own project, bring it back.

#	Class	The file you fill in
1	What Claude Is and Why This Matters Now	Two files: principles/context-block.md (your defaults) and projects/<your-client>/context.md, copied from _new-client/, for a real brief of your own
2	The Working Agreement	principles/claude-contract.md and projects/edubridge/claude-contract.md
3	The New Brief	projects/edubridge/brief-v3-interrogated.md and engagement.md
4	Claude as Critic	principles/design-taste.md, principles/anti-ai-slop.md, then projects/edubridge/critique-notes.md
5	Figma as Source of Truth	projects/edubridge/tokens.md
6	Claude Code and Building One Real Flow	projects/edubridge/my-booking-screen.html
7	How to Sell Yourself: Brand and Portfolio	career-vault/01-positioning.md, 02-portfolio-story.md, 06-proposal.md
8	How to Sell Yourself: The Interview	career-vault/03-resume.md, 04-interview-answers.md, 05-linkedin-content.md
Every file you fill in carries the same shape: what it is for, why Claude needs it, a filled EduBridge example, then a ## YOUR TURN section you answer in place. When you are done, delete the scaffolding above YOUR TURN. What is left is your real working file.

The repo you downloaded contains the finished version of everything. That is the answer key, not this week's homework. Only touch the current week's file.

Three rules about where files go
Root versus project. Root holds what is true about you: how you work, your taste, your voice, your skills. A project folder holds what is true about that client: their brief, their users, their constraints. Test: if it would still be true on your next job, it goes at root.
Select a Folder is a decision. Open Claude Code at the root when the work spans projects (writing your contract, building a skill). Open at the project folder when you are doing client work. Opening at the wrong level is how you get generic output, or one client's context leaking into another's.
Context has two levels, and rule 1 decides which. principles/context-block.md holds your defaults: the kind of designer you are, the clients who keep finding you, the surface you usually work on. projects/<client>/context.md holds that client's users and overrides your defaults. If your clients change every few weeks, which is normal, this split is what stops you starting from blank every time.
The nine-step process

Run them in order on any project. Skip a step and the next one does that step's work badly.

What's in here
claude-for-designers/
├── CLAUDE.md              what Claude reads when you open this folder
├── principles/            the knowledge layer: how you work
│   ├── claude-contract.md     your working contract with Claude
│   ├── design-taste.md        taste principles for designers using AI
│   ├── anti-ai-slop.md        patterns to refuse to ship
│   └── context-block.md       your defaults: your market, clients and surface
├── skills/                the capability layer: the nine commands
├── projects/              where work happens, one folder per client
│   ├── _new-client/           EMPTY TEMPLATE. Copy this for every real client
│   ├── _brief-bank/           four practice briefs that are not EduBridge
│   └── edubridge/             the worked example, brief through built screen
└── career-vault/          positioning, case study, proposal, resume, interview, profile
principles/ is the part most people skip and the part that makes the difference. Claude reads it before it does anything, so the first draft already sounds like your work instead of everyone's.

Install
Getting the repo. The green Code button on GitHub gives you a ZIP: download and unzip it, no Git needed. Or clone it if you know Git. The contents are identical. The unzipped folder may be named claude-for-designers-main, which is fine.

Model settings. Sonnet 5 at medium effort, for everything in this course. Do not spend your session budget on a bigger model.

Turning the nine skills into slash commands. You need this from Class 2, which is the first class that runs one (/grill-me).

No terminal. Open Claude Code at the root of this folder and paste this:

Install the nine skills in the skills/ folder as slash commands for me.
Each one needs to end up at ~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md, where
<skill-name> is the filename without .md. Do not change any of the contents.
Then list the nine folders you created so I can check.
That is it. Claude Code has file access, so it does the copying and tells you what it did. Restart Claude Code, type /, and the nine commands appear.

Getting Claude to do your setup is not cheating and it is not a shortcut. It is the first time in this course that you direct it at a real task instead of a design task, and it is a fair preview of the rest.

If you would rather run it yourself in a terminal
If the skills do not appear after a restart, that is an office hours question. Do not reinstall repeatedly.

Start your own client
Duplicate the empty template, never EduBridge. EduBridge is filled in as the answer key; duplicating it means dragging one client's users, tokens and decisions into another client's folder.

No terminal needed. Right-click the _new-client folder, choose Duplicate, rename the copy. On Windows, copy and paste it, then rename. Or just tell Claude Code: "duplicate the _new-client folder and call it acme-fintech."

Getting Claude to do the boring part is the point, not a shortcut.

You do this for the first time in Class 1, on a real brief of your own, and you do it again for every client after the course. Inside you get the six files the course teaches, empty, each carrying the questions it wants answered and one example of the standard.

projects/_new-client/README.md maps the eight classes onto a one-week engagement, because the course takes eight classes to teach a process that takes about a week to run. If you finish this course thinking the method needs two months, you will never use it on a real job.

No live client this week? projects/_brief-bank/ has four practice briefs that are deliberately not EduBridge: a desktop logistics dashboard, a Shopify storefront, a B2B landing page, and a Gulf booking app with Arabic and RTL. Each one breaks an assumption EduBridge would otherwise leave you with.

Going deeper
claudecodeguide.dev/for-designers has bite-sized guides for specific design workflows: brief decoding, critique gathering, research synthesis, handoff. Use it as your reference library once the skills are installed.

Ostad: Claude for UI/UX Designers is the eight-class course that walks through this workspace with EduBridge Bangladesh as the running example.
