# EduBridge BD: The PM Thread

**Reference, not homework.** This is the brief as it actually arrives: in fragments, out of order, contradicting the document. You read it, you do not edit it. Your work for Class 3 goes in `brief-v3-interrogated.md`.

*This is the second version of the brief. It does not arrive as a document. It arrives as a thread.*

The point of this file is to show you what really happens when a brief reaches the local team. Most BD designers receive something polished from an offshore client, then watch it deteriorate as a local PM adds context, scope, and contradictions in fragments. Read both versions and notice where they conflict.

**Subject:** Re: EduBridge BD: quick adds from the client

Hey,

Few things I forgot to loop you in on from yesterday's internal sync with Jamie's team.

1. Payment. I raised the card checkout with Jamie's team and it got complicated, so read this bit properly.

   They know about bKash. That was not the problem. Jamie's exact words were "fine, we'll swap the card form for a bKash button." His team is treating it as a logo change on one screen.

   Here is what I actually need you to work out. Cards do exist here, we can take them through SSLCOMMERZ, but most of our users will not have one. So realistically we need **both**: SSLCOMMERZ for the card minority, and bKash or Nagad for everyone else. And the mobile-money path is not their screen with a different button on it. You leave our site, you go to the bKash app, you enter your PIN, you get an OTP, you come back with a transaction ID that you type in by hand, and then it sits there until it is verified. That is not one screen.

   Jamie's team have not seen this happen. They have UK numbers showing the card checkout converting at 19% and they trust it, so "it needs to be different here" is going to need more from you than my say-so.

   Germany and the UAE are apparently getting the same one-checkout instruction. The UAE team have already pushed back about local cards. So we are not the only ones, which might help you or might not.

2. The navy and green brand colors: Jamie's team sent updated brand guidelines this morning. The green changed to `#00A651`. They also want to use the color for trust signals. Not sure what that means exactly, just flagging.

3. Client saw Preply last week and now they want video calling built into the booking flow. I told them MVP but they pushed back. Can you design for it and we will figure out the build side.

4. One more thing: parents are actually the real decision-makers here, not the students. Client agrees but didn't update the brief. Keep it in mind.

5. Timeline is same. End of month. Three weeks.

Let me know if you have Qs. I'm on calls most of the day but WhatsApp me.

**WhatsApp, 2:31 PM**
**[Rafi, PM]:** oh and Jamie's manager asked if we can add Bengali to the MVP. Jamie said optional but his manager said "strongly preferred." so probably yes. idk you decide lol

---

**WhatsApp, 6:55 PM**
**[Rafi, PM]:** forgot: client wants tutor background verification visible on the profile. like a badge. they said "trust is the main thing"

---

**WhatsApp, 6:58 PM**
**[Rafi, PM]:** also Jamie said "we can pivot fast if the market feedback is different": I think that means more work later, just flag it if timeline becomes an issue

---

**WhatsApp, 7:12 PM**
**[Rafi, PM]:** one last thing. budget is 3 lakhs for the full design sprint. so roughly 3 weeks of your time. client thinks that covers everything including revisions

## How this file is used in the course

- **Class 3:** you run `/design-brief` over this thread and the client brief together. It should surface the contradictions: desktop-first versus mobile-must, one global checkout versus a payment flow that is a different *shape* here, English versus Bengali, students-as-primary versus parents-as-decision-makers, and a three-week fixed budget that now has video calling in it. Your decisions go in `brief-v3-interrogated.md`, the commercial ones go in `engagement.md`, then `/persona-acid-test` checks whether they hold.
- **The payment item is the hardest one and it is not about brand names.** Nobody is confused about whether bKash exists. The question is what a mobile-money flow does to a checkout designed around one instant card screen, how many screens and error states that adds, and who pays for the extra work. That last part is why it lands in `engagement.md` as well as in the brief.
- **Class 4:** when you critique a generated screen, this thread is the reason most generated screens are wrong. They follow the client brief, not the real one.
